# Sandvox 2 Plug-In Examples

This repository provides examples based on two of Sandvox’s built-in plug-ins. Full documentation can found in the  [Sandvox Developer’s Guide](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/help/z/Sandvox_Developers_Guide.html). **Some familiarity with Cocoa programming is required.**

One thing to note is that the Developer’s Guide illustrates how to set up a new plug-in project using Xcode 3. An [Xcode 4 template](https://github.com/Abizern/Sandvox-2-PlugIn) is available from Abizern. If you use the template, we still recommend reading though the Guide so that you understand how the project is able to #import headers and link directly against the Sandvox application.

Also included is a multi-resolution (32px, 64px) image template that should be used as the base of any icon developed for your plug-in.

Between the documentation/reference and these examples, you should be able to see how to build a plug-in of your own. Let Karelia know if you have created a new plug-in so that we can help tell the world about it!

## Flickr

The Flickr plug-in uses Flickr’s badge API to include a Flickr photostream on a webpage. The main work of the plug-in happens in Template.html which is automatically parsed by the context during 

	- (void)writeHTML:(id <SVPlugInContext>)context

plugging in instance variable values according to the [template specification](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/help/z/HTML_Template.html). 

The plug-in also illustrates SVLocalizedString(), implementing a custom inspector class, and how to add custom CSS as a resource to the context.

## IFrame

The iFrame plug-in takes a different approach, writing to the context entirely in code with no Template.html. It illustrates implementing a placeholder, specifying particular metrics (width and height) for the object, and how to handle direct drag-and-drop of a URL. It’s action-packed in only a few lines of code!

####Both examples use Cocoa Bindings to bind controls in the inspector directly to the model via inspectedObjectsController.selection.####
